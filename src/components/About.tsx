              Hello! Iâ€™m Imansha, currently a 3rd-year Software Engineering
              undergraduate at the University of Kelaniya. My studies have given
              me a strong foundation in software development principles and a keen
              interest in building technology that makes an impact.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
              As a Full Stack Developer, I enjoy working across both frontend and
              backend development. This passion enables me to design seamless,
              interactive user interfaces while also creating efficient and scalable
              server-side systems that power modern web applications.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
              When I'm not coding, you can find me participating in hackathons.
              Also I am volunteering as a designer for several university clubs.
